# Keras-Style-Transfer (KeSTra)
An implementation of "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) in Keras

The code present in this repository is presented in this [blog](https://medium.com/@singhal.amogh1995/utilising-cnns-to-transform-your-model-into-a-budding-artist-1330dc392e25).

The code is written in Keras 2.2.2

============================================

## Installation notes
KeSTra is built using Python 3.5.  The easiest way to set up a compatible
environment is to use [Conda](https://conda.io/).  This will set up a virtual
environment with the exact version of Python used for development along with all the
dependencies needed to run KeSTra.

1.  [Download and install Conda](https://conda.io/docs/download.html).
2.  Create a Conda environment with Python 3. 

(**Note**: enter ```cd ~``` to go on **$HOME** , then perform these commands)

    ```
    conda create --name *your env name* python=3.5
    ```
   
   You will get the following, kestra-test is the env name used in this example
   
   ```
   Solving environment: done
